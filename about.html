        I am currently studying to be a full stack web developer to able to design and build websites one day for myself and others. 
        I ultimately wish to contribute to the growth of businesses both big and small. 
        I consider web development to be the proverbial storefront for any business, 
        judging by the ubiquitous presence of the Internet, and its exponential growth doesnâ€™t seem to be slowing down any time soon. 
        I am studying in HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js and in the past, I have studied Python and Java. 
        While I do prefer backend coding and software engineering specifically, 
        also being properly versed in frontend development also allows me to express myself creatively as well.

        When I'm not busy being a tech nerd, I'm busy being an "everything else" nerd.
        I love to play video games, enjoy anime, go to concerts and make music.
        I play guitar and dabble slightly in piano as well.
        I'm also a singer who is currently looking to re-enroll in voice lessons to keep my voice sharp.
        I also enjoy writing, reading books and meditating with brown noise.
