    <h4 class="app">Dictionary App</h4>
        <p class="dictionary-description">This is an <a href="https://competent-mclean-ec8055.netlify.app/">application</a> I made that can look up and define just about any word that you can think of. Almost. It also shows what parts of speech the word can be used in, as well as used in a sentence. </p>

    <h4 class="app">Weather App</h4>
        <p class ="weather-description">This is a <a href="https://admiring-rosalind-38eba5.netlify.app/">weather application</a> I made that can track the weather in real time in over 40 countries! It will also give you the highs and low temperature for that particularly city, as well as a pictoral representation of the weather.</p>
